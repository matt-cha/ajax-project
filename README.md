# villager-tunes

A web application for animal crossing video game enthusiasts who want to view characters and listen to in-game music according to the weather

## Why I Built This

As a fan of the game in my spare time and growing up playing this game, I wanted to build an application that would let me quickly display and see my favorite characters from the game and at a moment's notice listen to the music from the game that I often listen to while I study and work on my code.
